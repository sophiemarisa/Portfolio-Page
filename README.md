## Description

For this project I created my personal portfolio to showcase my website development work as I go through the course. I have created this as a place for people to go to see what I have created and worked on and so that they can easily contact me via email or LinkedIn. The website has been made responsive using flexbox and media queries to adapt to different viewport sizes. The portfolio work is clickable and you will be taken to that web application. 

## Installation 

N/A

## Usage

Website link: https://sophiemarisa.github.io/Portfolio-Page/

The website has a navigation bar at the top that takes you to the respective area of the web page with that information. The main content of the website is dicided into three sections: an about me containing a short description, a work area with space for 5 pieces of my work I want to showcase and a contact me section with clickable links. You can click on a piece of work to be taken to that respective web page, I only have one deployed at the moment and plan to update this as I build more throughout the course.
